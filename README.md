# HIVprimertestR
HIVprimertestR is an R-based pipeline designed to evaluate HIV-1 primers and probes using sequence polymorphism metrics. The pipeline calculates Hamming distances between primers/probes and input sequences and assesses oligo performance based on mismatch counts across viral populations.
